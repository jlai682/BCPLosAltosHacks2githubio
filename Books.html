    <p>For people who don't like the outdoors or exercise, books are another option. Reading books, particularly fiction, fully engages the mind and imagination. Any activity that possesses meditative qualities in which the brain is fully focused on a single task is proven to reduce stress and enhance relaxation. In a study conducted by the University of Sussex, individuals who had read for merely six minutes exhibited slower heart rates, less muscle tension, and reduced stress levels.</p>
 <p>Reading books that you enjoy and like helps to reduce stress levels</p>
